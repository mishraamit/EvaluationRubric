Data Science Project Evaluation Rubric
This rubric outlines the criteria for evaluating a data science project, categorized into the following areas:

Data Understanding & Preparation (25%)
Model Building & Evaluation (50%)
Coding Guidelines (5%)
Subjective Questions (20%)
Evaluation Criteria:

Data Understanding & Preparation (25%)

Meets Expectations: Data quality checks are performed thoroughly, and all issues are addressed appropriately with clear explanations in comments. Categorical variables are handled correctly. Dummy variables are created appropriately when applicable. New metrics are derived if relevant and used for analysis and modeling. Data is converted to a clean format suitable for analysis.
Does Not Meet Expectations: Data quality checks are lacking, or issues are not addressed correctly. Categorical variables are not handled appropriately. Dummy variables are created incorrectly or not at all. New metrics are not derived or not used for analysis. Data is not converted to a clean format suitable for analysis.
Model Building & Evaluation (50%)

Meets Expectations: Model parameters are tuned effectively with clear explanations for the approach. Both technical and business aspects are considered. Appropriate variable selection techniques are used. Multiple models are attempted, and the best one is chosen based on relevant performance metrics. Residual analysis is performed to validate model assumptions. Model evaluation follows best practices with appropriate metrics chosen. Achieves results comparable to the best possible model for the dataset. Model interpretation is clear and concise, with explanations of key variables and the model in simple terms within code comments.
Does Not Meet Expectations: Model parameters are not tuned adequately or incorrectly. Business aspects are disregarded during model building. Variable selection techniques are incorrect or not used. Limited exploration of models leads to a sub-optimal choice. Residual analysis is skipped, and model assumptions are not validated. Evaluation deviates from best practices, uses inappropriate metrics, or has errors in evaluation. Results fall short of the best possible model for the dataset. Model interpretation is lacking or incorrect. Code comments lack explanations for important variables and the model.
Coding Guidelines (5%)

Meets Expectations: Code includes clear and relevant comments throughout. Descriptive and unambiguous names are used for newly created variables. Code is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity. Maintains good code readability with consistent indentation.
Does Not Meet Expectations: Code lacks comments, making it difficult to understand. Variables are poorly or ambiguously named. Code is overly complex and exceeds the problem's needs. Poor indentation or other factors hinder code readability.
Subjective Questions (20%)

Meets Expectations: Answers are accurate, concise, and to the point. Examples are provided when necessary for clarity.
Does Not Meet Expectations: Answers are incorrect or excessively longwinded. Necessary examples are missing from the responses.
Overall:

This rubric provides a framework for evaluating the different stages of a data science project, ensuring a well-rounded assessment from data preparation to model building and communication through code and explanations.
